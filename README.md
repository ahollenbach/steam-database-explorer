Steam Database Explorer
=======================

The Steam Database Explorer is a Java GUI that fetches and presents some information obtained via the Steam API.
The project is under active development by Andrew Hollenbach and Andrew De Voe from the Rochester Institute of 
Technology.

This project uses the Java Steam Condenser to interact with the Steam API (https://github.com/koraktor/steam-condenser)
and the associated libraries required for Steam Condenser to run.

It also uses the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (http://jdbc.postgresql.org/).
